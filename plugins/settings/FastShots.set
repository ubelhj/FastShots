Fast Shots
9|Force either team to score shots with a minimum speed. Shoot too slow and it bounces out!
9|The current world record for shot speed without mutators at the time of this writing is 211. 
9|Be aware that numbers near or above 200 may be impossible to score.
9|Also be aware that if the maximum speed is below or equal to the minimum, it will be impossible to score
9|If the minimum speed is above the maximum, it will also be impossible to score
